#### Motivation
Provide a concept to a more user-friendly Operation Interface (OI) for the visually impaired to operate differnt (all) forms of computers. A that does not require 
</br>
</br>

#### Version History
- Version 1: Minimum working pipeline (utilities, data collection, modeling, training, evaluation, and live demo) with demonstrable but suboptimal performance
</br>

#### Future Versions
- Version 2: Collect more variations of training data to incorporate more shapes & sizes of bodies and hands to improve action recognition accuracy
- Version 3: Further refine training data and model to improve action recognition _efficiency_ (i.e. how long it takes to make an accurate prediction)

#### Algorithm
- Long/Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
